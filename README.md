# coordgen-rs
Rewrite of https://github.com/schrodinger/coordgenlibs in pure Rust

While coordgen is an amazing library and even has [Rust bindings](https://crates.io/crates/coordgen), its exposed API isn't very flexible, and its requirement of CMake and not working on Windows are prohibitive. Because of this, I'm trying to rewrite it in Rust.
